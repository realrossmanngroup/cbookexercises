1-19.c doesn't work, and I can't figure it out. 1-19_fixed.c works. 1-19_external_global_variable_version was an easier version once I realized I could use global variables. I did not know how to do that before so I spent an hour googling and learning how malloc works & dynamic memory assignment works so I could get my function to return a character array without knowing the size of it ahead of time, when all I had to do was declare a global variable. :( So technically both programs work but the external variable version is "simpler" to me even if it results in more lines of code. I feel more comfortable being able to actually storethe reversed text in a variable.
