psuedocode.md documents what I wanted the program to do, in plain English.

1-22.c was my first failed attempt. 1-22_tryagain.c was me trying to get it to work for a week, but still failing. 

1-22_tryagain_v2.c was when I realized I needed to collect the characters into the char array separately from the loop where I try to figure out where I am. This took a week and a half to figure out. Shame & flog me accordingly, I earned it.
