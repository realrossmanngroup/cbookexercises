exercise 1-24 is for the creation of a program that finds mismatched (), {}, and [] in C programs. 

Wish me luck!

I added a bunch of updates, wherewefail.md is where I need to pick up from when I get back to work on this. I am using `testprog.c` as my input to `1-24_correction_v1.c` which is the program for this exercise.
