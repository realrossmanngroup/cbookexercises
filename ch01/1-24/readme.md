exercise 1-24 is for the creation of a program that finds mismatched (), {}, and [] in C programs. 

Wish me luck!

I added a bunch of updates, wherewefail.md is where I need to pick up from when I get back to work on this. I am using `testprog.c` as my input to `1-24_correction_v1.c` which is the program for this exercise.

`1-24_correction_v2.c` fixed the stringinorout function as well as made the program massively more efficient when debuglogging by keeping track of how long each line is, and only iterating up to that point.
