This is supposed to replace tab with \t, backslashes with \\, and backspaces with \b. 

The problem is that backspaces aren't submitted to the program in modern terminals. So I tried to get it to submit everything as it is typed, but this results in a mess where each character I type is immediately duplicated. However, this is the only way I can think of to get it to recognize a backspace in a modern terminal! Ideally I would be able to have it output to a different part of the terminal than where I am inputting, but I'm on chapter 1... maybe later. 

Also, backspace doesn't show up as \b, but as ?^ which I will have to figure out how to fix. :(
