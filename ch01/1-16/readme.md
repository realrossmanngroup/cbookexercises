`2025_sample_word_exercise_from_book.c` is my solution to the puzzle as I go through this book again from scratch. It does work.

-  It prints out the longest line.
-  It counts the length of each line.
-  It only stores characters in the character array until you are close to the end of the array's alloted memory. 
-  Once you are past the array's alloted memory, it stops adding characters to the array to print, but it keeps counting characters.

My loop ends with the character counter `i` at 4094, though. I can't figure out why.

I did the exercise as it was written, but I still want to know why I can't go higher once I understand more of the underlying concepts. Later! I will come back to this.
